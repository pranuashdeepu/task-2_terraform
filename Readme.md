# AWS & Terraform Internship Assignment – Task 2

This repository contains my **AWS & Terraform internship assignment**, where I demonstrated basic AWS service knowledge and implemented **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** using **Terraform**.

---

## 📌 Assignment Objective

The goal of this task is to:
- Understand important AWS services
- Learn Terraform as an Infrastructure as Code tool
- Create AWS resources using Terraform
- Document the complete setup and deployment process

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**
  - EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
  - S3 (Simple Storage Service)
- **Terraform**
- **AWS CLI**
- **Git & GitHub**

## 📂 Repository Structure

| File Name | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `AWS assignment.docx` | Detailed notes on AWS services, Terraform concepts, and steps followed |
| `provider.tf` | AWS provider configuration |
| `main.tf` | Terraform configuration to create EC2 instance and S3 bucket |
| `image1.jpeg` | Screenshot of EC2 instance created successfully in AWS Console |

---

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Make sure the following tools are installed and configured:

- AWS Account
- AWS CLI (configured using `aws configure`)
- Terraform
- Git

## 🚀 Terraform Execution Steps

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/pranuashdeepu/task-2_terraform.git

## 🚀 Terraform Execution Steps

### Step 2: Initialize Terraform

terraform init

Step 3: Review the Execution Plan
terraform plan

Step 4: Apply the Configuration
terraform apply

✅ Output

EC2 instance created successfully using Terraform

S3 bucket created successfully using Terraform

Deployment proof is available in image1.jpeg



To delete all resources created by Terraform:

terraform destroy
