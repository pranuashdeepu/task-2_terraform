S3			unlimited Super safe storage           store photos, videos	     storage

EBS 			Harddisk for EC2 		      Database stoarge,keepdata      storage
								when EC2 stops

RDS 			Managed SQL databases		      wordpress,e-commernce	      Database

DynamoDB                 Fast No SQql database			Mobileapps,gamings scores     Database
		
Aurora 			Veryfast& reliable MYSQL version	High- traffic apps that 
				by AWS		                 need speed+ reliability     Database

VPC       		Your Private Network inside AWS		Keep servers hidden &        Networking
 								Secure from internet                     

cloudfront 		Super-fast content delivery(CDN)       Speed up websiteimages/videos Networking

Elastic load		Distributes Visitors across            Handle millions of user         Networking
Balancer                  many servers				without crashing

		
ECS/EKS/Forgate		run Docker containing			Modern microservices apps     containers

IAM			Who can do what(user,permission) 	Security very imp             security
Cloudwatch 		Monitoring+ logs+ alarms		know when server is sick   	Monitoring

SQS			Message queue(like whatapp message     Decouple services background    messageing
					in order)                 jobs						

SNS			send notifications                      order placed ,OTPs		Messageing

Route53			DNS+ domain names			point yourwebsite.com to AWS	 Networking

Grafana			Visualize & Monitor 			Graphs & alerts			Good for viewing

Kafka			Move & Store real-time events		Massive data streams		Extrmely high throughts

Terraform

What is Terraform?

Terraform is an open-source tool (by HashiCorp) for Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
You write plain text files describing what you want (e.g. "I want an EC2 server + S3 bucket").
Terraform talks to AWS APIs → creates/updates/deletes everything automatically — safely, repeatably, version-controlled (like Git for infra).

"Terraform bridges development and operations by making infrastructure reliable, auditable, and fast to change."

Terraform can manage low-level components like compute, storage, and networking resources, as well as high-level components like DNS entries and SaaS features.

How does Terraform work?

Terraform creates and manages resources on cloud platforms and other services through their application programming interfaces (APIs). 
Providers enable Terraform to work with virtually any platform or service with an accessible API.

The core Terraform workflow consists of three stages:

Write: You define resources, which may be across multiple cloud providers and services. 
For example, you might create a configuration to deploy an application on virtual machines in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network with security groups and a load balancer.
Plan: Terraform creates an execution plan describing the infrastructure it will create, update, or destroy based on the existing infrastructure and your configuration.

Apply: On approval, Terraform performs the proposed operations in the correct order, respecting any resource dependencies. 
For example, if you update the properties of a VPC and change the number of virtual machines in that VPC, Terraform will recreate the VPC before scaling the virtual machines.

Terraform Private Module Registry:

A private module registry is a repository for Terraform modules that is only accessible to a specific group of users, rather than being publicly available. 
Private module registries are useful for organizations that want to manage and distribute their own infrastructure code internally, rather than using publicly available modules from the Terraform Registry.

To use a private module registry, users need to configure their Terraform CLI to authenticate with the registry and access the modules. 
This typically involves setting up an access token or other authentication method and specifying the registry URL in the Terraform configuration.

Once configured, users can use the 'module' block in their Terraform configuration to reference the modules in the private registry, just like they would with publicly available modules. 
Private module registries can be hosted on a variety of platforms, including cloud providers, on-premises servers, and open-source tools.

Terraform Commands 
1. Terraform init - Initializes the working directory.
2. Terraform Plan - Creates an execution plan.
3. Terraform apply - Executes the changes.
4. Terraform destroy- Tears down everything.- Deletes all resources tracked in the state file.
5. Terraform import - Imports an existing resource into the Terraform state, allowing it to be managed by Terraform.
6. Terraform console- Opens an interactive console for evaluating expressions in the Terraform configuration.

Core Elements of Terraform

1. Terraform CLI: Terraform is an open-source tool that is packaged into a single executable binary, which you can download and run directly from the command line. 
This tool helps you automate the creation and management of infrastructure. 

2. Terraform Language:  Terraform uses HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) to define infrastructure. HCL is designed to be both easy to read by humans and understandable by machines, making it a great fit for DevOps tools.

Infrastructure elements managed by Terraform are called resources. These can include virtual machines, S3 buckets, VPCs, and databases.

4. Terraform Modules: In Terraform, a module is a container for a set of related resources that are used together to perform a specific task. Modules allow users to organize and reuse their infrastructure code, making it easier to manage complex infrastructure deployments.

Modules are defined using the ' module ' block in Terraform configuration. A module block takes the following arguments:

source: The source location of the module. This can be a local path or a URL.
name: The name of the module. This is used to reference the module in other parts of the configuration.
version: The version of the module to use. This is optional and can be used to specify a specific version of the module.

Advantages:
Speed & Efficiency: Spin up entire environments in minutes.
Multi-Cloud Strategy: Learn one language (HCL) and use it for AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.
Documentation: Terraform has excellent documentation and a massive community.

Disadvantages
State Management Risks: If the terraform.tfstate file is deleted or corrupted, Terraform loses track of your infrastructure.
Learning Curve: While HCL is simple, understanding how cloud resources relate to each other (dependencies) takes time.
